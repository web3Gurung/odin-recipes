    <h2>Description</h2>

        individually and frozen, they are easy to stuff in a pack on your way out the door.</p>

    <br>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the sesame seeds and sunflower seeds in a dry skillet over medium heat. Cook, stirring until
            fragrant and toasted. Salt lightly, and set aside to cool.
        </li>
        <li>Combine the dates, raisins, apricots, cherries, chocolate chips and the toasted seeds in the container of a
            food processor. Pulse to chop until small but not pasty. Transfer to a large bowl, and mix with oats and
            crisp rice cereal.
        </li>
        <li>In a small glass bowl, mix together the corn syrup, sugar and peanut butter. Heat in the microwave until
            bubbly. Stir in the powdered milk, vanilla, and almond extract. Pour the peanut butter mixture over the bowl
            of cereal and goodies, and mix with a wooden spoon until everything is evenly coated.

        </li>
        <li>Press the mixture into a greased 10x15 inch jellyroll pan using wet hands. Cut into squares, and allow to
            cool completely before removing from the pan.
